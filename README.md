Mean housing units per year:

housing_units_by_year

Group the data by year and average the results using mean:

prices_square_foot_by_year

Dataframe that groups year and neighborhood by the mean of the groups:

prices_by_year_by_neighborhood

Neighborhood coordinates:

neighborhood_locations_df

Using original sfo_data_df dataframe create a dataframe that groups results by mean:

all_neighborhood_info_df
